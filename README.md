# Overview

- The available time is 60 minutes
- Don't worry if you can't finish everything. Try to do as much as possible.
- You might not use any kind of help(internet, other people, etc..).
Try to imagine that you are taking this test offline on a paper.
- You might not ask questions during the test

## Tips and tricks

- Write your answers after the questions.
- For programming tasks, use the formatting syntax of the markdown language,
for example for java code:

```text
  `` `java
  Your Java code should come here
  `` `
```

### Programming tasks

- **You must not use an IDE**
- You don't need to handle every edge case
- It doesn't matter if the program is not correct syntactically,
the structure is the important part. You might also write pseudo code.

### Short questions

- Try to elaborate on every important aspect of the question even if it's
not explicitly asked.
- You don't have too much time, short straightforward answers are expected.
Depends on the question but keep it around 2-3 sentences.
